 * @author Dieter Weninger

 *
 * This presolver looks for independent components at the end of the presolving.
 * If independent components are found in which a maximum number of discrete variables
 * is not exceeded, the presolver tries to solve them in advance as subproblems.
 * Afterwards, if a subproblem was solved to optimality, the corresponding
 * variables/constraints can be fixed/deleted in the main problem.
