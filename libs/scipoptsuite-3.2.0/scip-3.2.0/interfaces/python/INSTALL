Building python-scip
====================

Before building the python-scip wrapper, you need to download the SCIP
Optimization Suite from http://scip.zib.de.
After extracting the archive, build the shared library with

    make SHARED=true scipoptlib

This will result in the creation of the directory "<path_to_scipopt/lib>" and
the shared library will be created there.

There are several ways to install/build python-scip:

a) In the python-scip directory, execute

      python setup.py build_ext --inplace

   Additionally, it is necessary to append the path to the python-scip directory to
   your PYTHONPATH. This is achieved with the following command,

      export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_python-scip>

   The result of this script is the production of the file pyscipopt/scip.so in the pyscipopt directory.
   the file can then be imported directly in your Python code to interface with SCIP.

b) In the python-scip directory, execute

      python setup.py install [--prefix=<path-to-custom-python-packages>]

   This will perform a global installation or put the compiled package into the directory
   specified by --prefix.

When running the setup.py script, you will be prompted for the path to the shared library,
which will be similar to

   <path_to_scipopt/lib>/libscipopt-3.1.0.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.so

additionally, you will be prompted for the path to the scip source code, which
will be similar to

   <path_to_scipopt>/scip-3.1.0/src

To test the library, simply run "py.test".


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

In case you input the wrong paths after running

   python setup.py build_ext --inplace

you can delete the link by running

   python setup.py cleanlib

If this does not work, it is possible to manually delete the links
in the folders "include" and "lib".
