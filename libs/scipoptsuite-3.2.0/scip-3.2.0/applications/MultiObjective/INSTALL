The Multiobjective code requires the lemon graph
library. We tested the code with versions 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 of the library.

For compilation, please follow these steps:

1. install the lemon graph library (http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/)
2. compile the example using "make"
	-typing make for the first time should automatically hint you to enter
	 the path to the lemon library in case that the library is not installed
	 systemwide.
	 In this case, "lib/lemon" should point to the main directory of your lemon installation
	 containing the subdirectories "include" and "lib", i.e.
	 "lib/lemon/include/lemon/list_graph.h" should exist
3. call "make links" or manually reset the symbolic link if you want to change the lemon installation
